As in the description I try to develop a Hitman like Gameboy experience.
I call it Hitman: Silent Code
It's being made with GB Studio (Website:https://www.gbstudio.dev/)
Also with every release I will upload:
1. The compiled Gameboy Rom (obviously)
2. But also the full projekt folder
I try to be open-source. For questions either here on Github or under: hitman.gameboy.project@gmail.com
Please don't expekt to much, because this is my first bigger project.

I don't expect anyone to see this but I may be proven wrong
